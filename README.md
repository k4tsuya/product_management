# Snack Bar Product & Allergen Management API

## 📌 Project Overview

This project started from a **real, practical need** at my current **part-time job** in a snackbar in the Netherlands.

As a food business, we are legally required to:

* Maintain a clear and correct **allergen list**
* Be able to tell customers **which allergens are present in which products**
* Follow EU / NVWA (Nederlandse Voedsel- en Warenautoriteit) food allergen regulations

Managing this information manually quickly became error‑prone and time‑consuming. This project is my attempt to **solve that real-world problem with software**, while at the same time **learning and exploring new backend technologies**.

---

## 🚧 Project Status

This project is **actively under development** and is being built step by step as a learning project.

It is intended to become part of my **developer portfolio**, showcasing how I approach real-world backend problems, data modeling, and new technologies.

---

## 🎯 Goals of This Project

* Model food allergens **correctly and realistically**
* Link allergens to products in a flexible way
* Create a clean and understandable backend foundation
* Learn and practice technologies I have not used deeply before
* Build a meaningful portfolio project based on real business needs

---

## 🧠 Domain Modeling

A key design decision in this project is **how allergens are modeled**.

* Allergens are **not boolean fields** on a product
* Allergens are a **fixed, regulated list** (EU / NVWA)
* Products can contain **multiple allergens**
* One allergen can apply to **multiple products**

Because of this, the project uses a **many‑to‑many relationship** between:

* `Product`
* `Allergen`

This approach:

* Matches real‑world legislation
* Avoids fragile database schemas
* Makes the system easy to extend in the future (e.g. “may contain traces of”)

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

I intentionally chose this tech stack to **learn and explore different tools** beyond what I already knew.

* **Python 3.13**
* **FastAPI** – modern, fast backend framework
* **SQLAlchemy 2.0** – ORM with explicit, type‑safe models
* **SQLite** – simple local database for development
* **Pydantic** – data validation and API schemas

Although I have previous experience with **Django + DRF**, this project focuses on:

* Understanding lower‑level ORM concepts
* Explicit database modeling
* Clear separation between models, schemas, and application logic


## 🧪 Example Data

The application automatically seeds:

### Allergens (simplified example)

* Gluten
* Milk
* Soy
* Mustard

### Products

* **Frikandel** → gluten, soy, mustard
* **Kroket** → gluten, milk
* **Bread** → gluten

This data is inserted on application startup and is safe to run multiple times.

## 🚀 Running the Project

### 1a. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn sqlalchemy pydantic
```

### 1b. OPTIONAL: Set the preferred language for the generated pdf file.

Set the `language` variable in the `generate_allergen_matrix_pdf()` method (main.py) to `'en'` (English) or `'nl'` (Dutch).

```
language: str = "en"
```


### 2. Start the development server

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### 3. Open the API documentation

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```

FastAPI automatically provides interactive Swagger documentation.

## 🔍 Available Endpoints

* `GET /products` – list products with their allergens
* `GET /allergens` – list all known allergens
* `GET /products/pdf` - generate a downloadable pdf file

---

## 📚 What I Learned From This Project

* How to model **many‑to‑many relationships** correctly
* The difference between **ORM models** and **API schemas**
* How to translate **legal/business requirements** into data models

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

Planned extensions include:

* Product creation via API (`POST /products`)
* Support for **“may contain traces of”** allergens
* Financial data (purchase price, retail price)
* PostgreSQL support
* Automated tests
* Exportable allergen reports (PDF)

---

## 💬 Final Note

This project is part of my **personal learning journey and portfolio** and will continue to evolve over time.

This project is intentionally **practical**.

It represents how I approach backend development:

* Start from real requirements
* Model the domain carefully
* Prefer clarity over complexity
* Learn by building

Feedback and suggestions are always welcome.
